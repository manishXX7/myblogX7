            <h2>MY JOURNEY INTO IT</h2>
            <p>Posted by <span class="author">Manish Rauniyar</span> on <span class="date">October 5, 2023</span></p>
            <p> My journey into the world of IT coding has been a thrilling adventure marked by curiosity, 
                challenges, and endless possibilities. It all started with a simple curiosity about how the
                 digital world around us works. As I delved deeper, I found myself captivated by the elegant
                  lines of code that power our modern lives. From my early days grappling with basic syntax
                   to the exhilaration of creating complex software solutions, I've come to realize that
                    coding is not just a skill; it's a gateway to creativity and problem-solving. In this blog, I'll take you on a retrospective tour of my coding odyssey, sharing the highs and lows,
                 the breakthroughs and lessons learned, as I continue to navigate this ever-evolving 
                 landscape of IT coding."</p>

            <h2>MY BELIEVE SANATANA DHARMA </h2>
            <p>Posted by <span class="author">Manish Rauniyar</span> on <span class="date">October 5, 2023</span></p>
             <p>In a world where change is constant and the quest for meaning is unending,
                 I've found solace and purpose in the timeless wisdom of Sanatana Dharma, also known
                  as Hinduism. It's not just a religion; it's a way of life that has deeply resonated 
                  with my soul.Sanatana Dharma teaches us that truth is eternal and that all 
                  living beings are interconnected
                <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                    This philosophy has allowed me to see beyond the superficialities of life and dive into the depths of spirituality. Here are some key aspects that have shaped my belief in Sanatana Dharma:

The Law of Karma: The concept of karma, the law of cause and effect, has helped me understand the consequences of my actions. It encourages me to make choices that align with my higher self and values.

Dharma - My Righteous Duty: Sanatana Dharma emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's duty (dharma) with sincerity and integrity. It has guided me in making ethical decisions in both my personal and professional life.

The Pursuit of Moksha: The ultimate goal in Sanatana Dharma is liberation from the cycle of rebirth (moksha). This aspiration has inspired me to seek self-realization and inner peace through meditation and self-reflection.

Pluralism and Tolerance: Sanatana Dharma is inherently pluralistic, accommodating various paths to spiritual realization. It has taught me to embrace diversity and respect the beliefs of others.

The Practice of Yoga: Yoga, both physical and spiritual, is an integral part of Sanatana Dharma. It has not only improved my physical health but also deepened my connection with my inner self.

My journey into Sanatana Dharma has been transformative. It has enriched my life with a profound sense of purpose, inner peace, and a deeper understanding of the world around me. Through my blog, I hope to share my experiences and insights, and connect with others who are also on a spiritual journey. 
Together, we can explore the timeless wisdom and beauty of Sanatana Dharma</span></p>
